# Setting Up a Notion API Package in Turborepo

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This guide covers setting up a **Notion API package** within a **Turborepo monorepo** that interacts with the **Notion API** to manage databases, pages, and content programmatically.

Using **Turborepo**, you can efficiently manage Notion API interactions as a shared package while keeping dependencies modular and scalable.

## ðŸš€ Why Use a Notion API Package in Turborepo?
- **Code Reusability**: Centralize Notion API logic across multiple apps.
- **Improved Maintainability**: Keep API handling separate from the main applications.
- **Scalability**: Easily extend API integrations with more functionality over time.
