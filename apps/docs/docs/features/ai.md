# Setting Up an AI Package in Turborepo

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This guide covers setting up an **AI package** within a **Turborepo monorepo** that provides two OpenAI API functions:
- **Assistant API**
- **Chat Completion API**

Using **Turborepo**, you can efficiently manage AI-related functions as a shared package while keeping dependencies modular and scalable.

## ðŸš€ Why Use an AI Package in Turborepo?
- **Code Reusability**: Share AI-related utilities across multiple apps.
- **Faster Development**: Centralize AI logic instead of duplicating it in different projects.
- **Performance Optimization**: Utilize caching and optimized dependency management.

## ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion
By structuring AI-related functionalities as a separate package inside **Turborepo**, you achieve better **code reusability, maintainability, and scalability** across multiple apps.
