- **LinkedIn OAuth**
- **GitHub OAuth**
- **Google OAuth**

Using **Turborepo**, you can efficiently manage authentication logic as a shared package while keeping dependencies modular and scalable.

## ðŸš€ Why Use an Auth Package in Turborepo?
- **Code Reusability**: Centralize authentication logic across multiple apps.
- **Security Best Practices**: Use NextAuthâ€™s built-in security features.
- **Scalability**: Easily extend authentication providers.
