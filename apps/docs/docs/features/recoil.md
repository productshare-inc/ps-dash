## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This guide covers setting up a **Recoil state management package** within a **Turborepo monorepo** to efficiently manage application state.

Using **Turborepo**, this package enables centralized state management, making it reusable and scalable across multiple applications.

## ðŸš€ Why Use a Recoil Package in Turborepo?
- **Centralized State Management**: Keep shared state logic in one place.
- **Reusability**: Use the same state across different apps in the monorepo.
- **Scalability**: Manage complex state interactions with ease.
