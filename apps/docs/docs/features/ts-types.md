# TypeScript Types Package in Turborepo

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This guide covers setting up a **TypeScript types package** within a **Turborepo monorepo** to manage shared type definitions and interfaces.

Using **Turborepo**, this package enables centralized type management, making it reusable across multiple applications.

## ðŸš€ Why Use a TypeScript Types Package in Turborepo?
- **Centralized Type Definitions**: Keep all TypeScript types in one place.
- **Reusability**: Share common interfaces across different apps in the monorepo.
- **Consistency**: Ensure all projects use the same type structures.

## ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion
By structuring TypeScript types as a separate package inside **Turborepo**, you achieve better **code reusability, maintainability, and consistency** across multiple apps.
