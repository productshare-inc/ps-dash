# Setting Up Next.js in Turborepo

## üìå Introduction
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes. When used within a **Turborepo** monorepo, it allows for efficient, modular, and scalable web application development.

This guide covers the installation, usage, and deployment of a **Next.js application** inside a **Turborepo** setup.

## üöÄ Why Use Next.js in a Turborepo?
- **Efficient Code Sharing**: Share components, utilities, and configurations across multiple apps.
- **Faster Builds**: Utilize Turborepo caching for optimized performance.
- **Microfrontend Ready**: Manage multiple frontend apps within a single monorepo.
- **Optimized Deployment**: Easily deploy with Vercel, Cloudflare, or other cloud platforms.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installing Next.js in Turborepo

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to Your Turborepo Project
Ensure you are inside your **Turborepo** workspace:
```sh
cd my-turborepo
```

For TypeScript support:
```sh
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-app --typescript
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
Move into the `nextjs-app` directory and install dependencies:
```sh
cd nextjs-app
npm install
```


This ensures that Next.js builds are properly cached within the monorepo structure.

---

## üìú Running the Next.js App Locally
To start the Next.js development server, run:
```sh
npm run dev
```
Visit `http://localhost:3000/` to see your application in action.

To test it inside the monorepo, run from the root:
```sh
turbo dev --filter=nextjs-app
```

## üéØ Conclusion
Using **Next.js** inside a **Turborepo** allows for an efficient and scalable web development workflow. The monorepo approach ensures shared dependencies, faster builds, and better modularization.
