## DevOps: Docker, Vercel, and Coolify

### Why Docker?

Docker ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments. The boilerplate includes:

- A `Dockerfile` for both the frontend and backend.
- A `docker-compose.yml` for local development.

### CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Vercel

In the development environment, the boilerplate integrates with Vercel for seamless deployments. Automated workflows include:

- Linting and testing.
- Building and deploying Docker containers.
- Running database migrations.

### Production with Coolify on AWS EC2

For production, the boilerplate leverages Coolify, an open-source platform for self-hosted deployments. Key benefits include:

- Simplified setup for deploying Docker containers.
- Integration with AWS EC2 for scalable infrastructure.
- Enhanced control over production workloads.
